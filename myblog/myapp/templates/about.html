            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high
                cornering speeds achieved through generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this
                downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence
                behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the cars following directly behind,
                making it hard to overtake. Major changes made to the cars for the 2022 season have resulted in greater
                use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the
                goal of making overtaking easier. The cars are dependent on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and
                tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids,
                were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned
                since 2004 and 2008, respectively.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Formula One originated from the European Motor Racing Championships of the 1920s and 1930s. The
                    formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a new
                    formula agreed upon during 1946 to officially become effective from 1st January 1947. The first
                    Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix anticipating the
                    official start of the formula. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations had
                    made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship before but due to the
                    suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become
                    formalised until 1946, to become effective from 1st January 1947. The new World Championship was
                    instituted to commence in 1950.</li>
                <li>The first world championship race took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May
                    1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly
                    defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio went on to win the championship in 1951, 1954,
                    1955, 1956, and 1957. This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a
                    record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.</li>
                <li>A Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite being regarded as
                    one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One
                    championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second place in the championship four times and
                    in third place the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered â€“ still the record
                    for the highest Formula One wins percentage by an individual driver. National championships existed
                    in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by
                    promoters for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in
                    1983.</li>
                <li>This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari,
                    Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which
                    were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated
                    engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful
                    cars, due to concerns over the lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula
                    for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz
                    introduced their W196. The W196 featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as:
                    desmodromic valves, fuel injection and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the
                    championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due
                    to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.</li>

            <h2>Grands Prix</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons each contained 22 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races. 24 races are scheduled for the 2024 season.</li>
                <li>Six of the original seven races took place in Europe: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>British Grand Prix</li>
                        <li>Monaco Grand Prix</li>
                        <li>Indianapolis 500 (not a Formula One race, but counted towards the World Championship)</li>
                        <li>Swiss Grand Prix</li>
                        <li>Belgian Grand Prix</li>
                        <li>French Grand Prix</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
